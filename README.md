[Consumer Complaints](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heemalichaudhari/consumer-complaints)
### Conclusions
#### What are the products and sub products with the most complaints
Mortgage, Debt collection, Credit reporting accounts for almost 70% of all complaints. Under this, we have Other mortgage, Conventional fixed mortgage and checking accounts as the most complained about sub products. We need to investigate and focus on this products to know what exactly is causing so much of the complaints and try to automate or fix most of it.
#### How quickly is the complaint sent to the company after its received
Only about half of the complaints were sent to the company involved on the same day, some were sent months after. Its important to try to send all complaints to the company the same day to ensure timely resolution.
#### Complaints resulting to dispute
Complaints closed without relief or explanation is twice as likely to results in a dispute than complaints closed with relief. 60% of complaints regarding Virtual Currency results in a dispute while 23% of complaints regarding Mortgage results in a dispute. 100% of Issues where the lender damaged or destroyed the property are disputed while 43% of the cases where the lender sold the property are disputed. 
##### About 80% of companies have less than 30% of their complaints resulting to a disputes.
##### About 67% of complaints is submitted through the web and almost no complaints are sent via email.

##### I will suggest that we investigate the cause of the high complaints by talking to customers, grouping them based on what they complain about and see if it can be automated or solved. Also, keeping customers in the loop always would help to minimise complaints.
